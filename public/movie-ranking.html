 <hr />
 <h3>Lift</h3>
 <p>This movie should the power of principle even in the life of someone tagged a criminal.</p>
 <h3>Prayer Room</h3>
 <p>What stood out to me in this movie was its reflection of the power of prayer in any suitation of life. The world is controlled by supernatural forces and you must tune to one to stand out even in your marriage life.</p> 
<h3>Woman King</h3>
 <p>It showed us the rich culture of the ancient African empires and most importantly focused on the Dahomey Empire's king, who empowered women and advocated for equality in men and women. A leader who believed in and loved his people irrespective of the odds against him and his idealogies.</p>
